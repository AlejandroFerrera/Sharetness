# Sharetness

Hi CS50, I'm Alejandro Ferrera, I'm from Cuba but I'm living in Chile right now. I am a software engenieer student from an institute here in Chile. I'm here today to present my Final Project. The idea behind this project is to create a forum for fitness people. People here can create rooms with diferent topics and share some ideas in chat. The project was created on Django, I wanted to learn django because Python is my favorite language and django is the most required framework by employers.
